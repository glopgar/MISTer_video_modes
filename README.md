# MISTer_video_modes
A list of custom MISTer video_modes 

This is a list of vide_mode settings for several display resolution and frequencies.
The information has been parsed from http://www.tinyvga.com/vga-timing and
converted to `mister.ini` file format for each resolution.

## Usage
Just copy the `video_mode` line corresponding to your monitor specs and paste it
in the corresponding section of your `mister.ini` file.
Don't forget to remove the `;` charater in order for the line to work.
