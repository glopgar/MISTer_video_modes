# MISTer custom video modes configuration list
A list of custom MISTer video_modes 

This is a list of `video_mode` settings for several display resolution and frequencies.
The information has been parsed from http://www.tinyvga.com/vga-timing and
converted to `mister.ini` file format for each resolution.

List is here:
[VIDEO MODES LIST FILE](mister_video_modes.ini)

More modes (thans to Paco from MISTer FPGA Telegram channel): [MORE MODES](mister_video_modes_retrorgb.ini) 
## Usage
Just copy the `video_mode` line corresponding to your monitor specs and paste it
in the corresponding section of your `mister.ini` file.
Don't forget to remove the `;` charater in order for the line to work.
